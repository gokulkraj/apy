## üåê Open Source

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio or any other projects. You are granted the freedom to modify, distribute, and use the code for any purpose, unleashing your creativity without any restrictions.

If you have any improvements, ideas or find any bugs, don't hesitate to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## üõë Important Note

1. Do not push your Nodemailer pass on Github as it can give access to your google email. Use `.env` file
2. Use [Nextjs api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) for nodemailer transporters and send mail function as they only run on server and cannot expose your google app variables to client.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Setup Nodemailer

### Create Nodemailer User and Password

1. Go to your Google Mail app or any other Google App.
2. Click on your `Profile`
3. Click on `Manage your Google Account`
4. Click on `2-Step Verification` under How you sign in Google
5. Under 2-Step Verification go to `App passwords`
6. Create an app. Give a name `e.g: portfolio-nodemailer`
7. Copy the password somewhere safe and use it as the value for `NODEMAILER_PASS` variable in `.env` and your email as the value for `NODEMAILER_USER` variable. [ Note: You cannot see the password once it is closed. In case you forget to copy just delete the old app and create new app ]

### ‚ú® Seo

1. sitemap.xml and robots.txt are generated automatically inside public folder using the file structure of the project using the scripts located at `src/scripts/generateSitemap.mjs` after project is build or `pnpm sitemap`.
2. Note: Dynamic routes are not included from sitemap.xml.A [Dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) is a file or folder name in square brackets: [segmentName]. For example, [id] or [slug].
3. Google Site Verification tag content can be added in `src/data/siteMetadata.mjs` to verify for Google Search Console.
